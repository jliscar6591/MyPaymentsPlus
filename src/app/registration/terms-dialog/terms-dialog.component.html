The MyPaymentsPlus  website and related services are offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance without modification of these Terms of Service. From time to time, it may be necessary for us to update or revise certain provisions of the Terms of this Agreement. By using this Web Site or accepting the Agreement, you agree that we may change the terms of this Agreement in our sole discretion without specific notice to you. If you don't agree to the changes proposed by us, or to any terms in this Agreement, your only remedy is to cancel your use of the services offered under this Agreement.

  <div class="mat-title">1. Description of Service</div>
  <br />We operate this Web site and associated web pages, which, for purposes of these Terms of this Agreement, will be referred to as the "MyPaymentsPlus  Web Site(s)". We offer you access to the MyPaymentsPlus Web Sites, which provides you access to a collection of resources, including, but not limited to, allow authorized users to process credit/debit card and electronic check payments to participating schools, school districts, and communities (the "Service"). The Service helps you make payments to participating schools, school districts, and communities ("Schools"). We offer you access to the MyPaymentsPlus  Web Site in exchange for your payment of the fees, as applicable, and your agreement to accept and comply with the terms, conditions, policies and notices stated here and as may be modified by us from time-to-time in our sole discretion without notice to you. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features or products that change, augment or enhance the current Service shall be subject to this Agreement. We do not have control of or liability for the products or services that are paid for with our Service and do not guarantee that a particular School or Community will complete a transaction. You understand that we are not a bank and that the Service is being provided on behalf of the School or Community as an electronic payment processing service rather than a banking service. Completion of your payment transaction is contingent upon both the authorization of payment by your credit/debit card company or financial institution/bank and acceptance of your payment by the participating School or Community. In the event your payment is not processed or authorized by your card company or financial institution or to the extent the applicable School or Community you are seeking to pay fails to accept your payment, your payment liability shall remain outstanding and unpaid and you will be subject to all applicable penalties, late fees and interest charges assessed by the applicable School or Community, all of which obligations remain your sole responsibility. The Service may be accessed by either telephone or the Internet. It is your responsibility to meet these requirements. Use of the Service by telephone requires that access to a Touch-Tone telephone. Use of the Service by the Internet (i) requires access to the Internet, (ii) requires appropriate Internet browser software, (ii) and may require other associated hardware and/or software. We recommend that you use a web browser that supports SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) 128-bit encryption. Your browser should be Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0 or above, or Mozilla Firefox 3.0 or above.

  <br /><br />
  <div class="mat-title">4. Information</div>
  <br />Use of the Service is granted to legally authorized parents, guardians, account holders, and their designees, all to the extent at least 18 years old and a resident of the United States ("Authorized Users"). You must give us the requested information that is current, true, accurate and complete. You are not permitted to use this Service on behalf of another party or use an unauthorized name. You also agree not to impersonate any person or entity, misrepresent any affiliation with another person, entity or association, use false headers or otherwise conceal your identity from us for any purpose. We will treat with care the information you entrust to us, in accordance with the disclosures we provide and in our Privacy Statement. If we find or determine that any of the information you provide is outdated, false, inaccurate, or incomplete, we may terminate your use of the Service immediately and for all future use. This action on our part does not limit other remedies at law or in equity we may pursue to recover costs, losses, or other expenses we incur as a result of the information or lack of information you provide. We shall not be responsible/liable for payments made to any School, Community or other third parties or for payments made in incorrect amounts because of errors made by you. If you use the Service, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your personal information and for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You should notify Service Provider immediately if you believe there has been unauthorized use of your account or password or any other breach of security in connection with the Service. We will not be liable for any actions or transfers by any other individual that uses your user name and/or password or identity with or without your consent or knowledge. Upon providing us with your information, you are authorizing us, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary to confirm your information. This may include ordering a credit report and performing other forms of credit checks including verification against third party databases. We reserve the right to impose daily volume or dollar amount sending limits from time to time. Senders may not exceed this limit in any given 24 hour period. If you used the Service prior to January 1, 2008, you hereby authorize, ratify and approve of the transfer of your data (such as, but not limited to, credit card data settings, low balance email reminder settings, auto-replenish settings, user names, passwords, email addresses and registration information) from Horizon's previous third party provider (EPOS Corporation) to Horizon, and you further hereby authorize, ratify and approve of Horizon's provision of such data to Horizon's current or future third-party providers and such providers' use of such data in order to provide you with the Service.
  <br /><br />
  <div class="mat-title">5. Payments to Schools and Communities</div>
  <br />Depending on the methods approved by your participating School or Community, you may make payments by using either a credit/debit card or by electronic check using a valid U.S. bank account. All monies deposited into this Service are paid to the Service Provider, who agrees to attempt to deposit the monies into a School or Community owned back account on your behalf. The Service Provider shall retain possession of the funds until they are deposited into the School's or Community's designated account. If the School or Community fails to accept the payment, those monies will be returned to the Authorized User. Any disputes or allegations regarding the payment must be addressed to Horizon. The School or Community receives the proceeds of all payments less any program fees associated with the transaction, as described in this Agreement. Use of payments at the School or Community is governed exclusively by your agreement or arrangement with the School or Community, and we are not responsible for the School's or Community's handling of payments after depositing the payment into the School's or Community's designated account. Payments will be processed promptly and submitted to the School or Community. However, a number of factors, several of which are outside of our control, will contribute to when the funds are received by the School or Community. We make no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing, such as delays in the banking system or the U.S. mail service; any durations listed on the website are for example purposes only. We reserve the right to hold funds beyond the normal periods for transactions that appear suspicious or fraudulent. Certain school districts and communities offer Authorized Users the ability to purchase sponsored items and pay for related fees. Payments for such transactions are accepted by our Service, but fulfilled by the School or Community. You agree to resolve any disputes regarding the items or fees with the School or Community.
  <br /><br />
  <div class="mat-title">6. Electronic Checks</div>
  <br />The following terms apply to the extent you use the Service to process payments by electronic check. When you make a payment through the Service by electronic check, you are requesting an electronic fund transfer from your designated bank account. Upon receipt of such request, we will make electronic transfers via the Automated Clearing House ("ACH") system from your U.S. bank account in the amount specified. Your request constitutes your authorization for such electronic transfers to be made by us. You may be charged a service fee for any ACH transactions that result in a returned ACH item, such as but not limited to those caused by insufficient funds in your bank account, closure of your bank account, or if the bank account number or other information you provided is incorrect. We reserve the right to resubmit for collection any ACH debit authorized by you that is returned for insufficient or uncollected funds. You must provide a valid bank account to be electronically debited by us. Please be advised that we reserve the right to reject any accounts at certain banks for the use of our Service. In addition, we may require additional information and confirmation at our sole discretion or at the discretion of your School or Community. In general, consumer and business checking and savings accounts are permitted for designation and use of us; note that some cash management, sweep, and/or investment accounts will not permit use of the Service. It is very important that you contact us as well as contact your financial institution/bank at once if someone has transferred or may transfer money from your account without your permission. Under applicable banking regulations, the extent of your liability for an unauthorized transaction is largely determined by your promptness in notifying your bank if a transfer or withdrawal in your monthly statement is incorrect or unauthorized. Please be sure to review your terms and conditions as provided to you by your financial institution/bank related to your Electronic Fund Transfer Rights and Error Resolution.
  <br /><br />
  <div class="mat-title">7. Credit and Debit Card Transactions</div>
  <br />The following terms apply to the extent you use the Service to process payments by credit/debit card. Your use of the Service to process payments from your credit card or debit card are subject to and in accordance with your agreement with your corresponding credit card or debit card company, in addition to the terms of this Agreement.
  <br /><br />
  <div class="mat-title">8. Payment Request Restrictions</div>
  <br />At our sole discretion, we reserve the right to restrict payment requests for any one of the following reasons (i) Unauthorized or unusual use of your designate bank account; (ii) Transfer or receipt of fraudulent or suspected fraudulent funds; (iii) Detection of excessive disputes or reversals, or "kiting" type attempts; (iv) Failure to cooperate in an investigation, disputes, or provide additional requested information when requested; (v) Any noncompliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (vi) Failure to confirm any personal or bank account information previously provided by you associated with the use of our Service; or (vii) Insufficient funds, returns, or reversals of any kind related to your bank account. We will use reasonable efforts to research and resolve such matters as specified above to reach a conclusion as quickly as reasonably possible for all parties involved. In the event there is a dispute covering a specific transaction, we may restrict the electronic funds related to that particular transaction. We may also restrict all transactions for a designated period of time or as necessary in our sole discretion to protect ourselves against the risk or returns or reversals.
  <br /><br />
  <div class="mat-title">9. Fees and Charges</div>
  <br />You may be required to pay a fee for the convenience of paying amounts using the Service ("Program Fee"). If you are required to pay a Program Fee, you will be notified of the exact amount of the Program Fee prior to making your payment. The Service Provider and/or the School or Community, or their designee, reserve the right to take certain actions in the event that an electronic check payment cannot be collected for any reason, including, but not limited to, "NSF" or invalid account information. These actions include, but are not limited to, charging a return check fee of the lesser of $30 or the maximum amount allowed by law, deducting the uncollected amount from your designated bank account, directly deducting the return check fee from your designated bank account, deducting the return check fee from the student or resident accounts funded by the declined transaction, and/or taking any other actions allowed by law and/or school district or community policy. The returned check fee may be the maximum amount allowed by law or as defined by School or Community policy. We also reserve the right not to accept check payments for Authorized Users in the future and to notify the School or Community of the returned/uncollectible check payment. The Service Provider and/or the School or Community reserve the right to take certain actions in the event that a credit/debit card transaction is disputed and cannot be collected once approved. These actions include, but are not limited to, reversal of payment transaction, deducting the uncollectible amount directly from your designated bank account, deducting the uncollectible amount directly from the student or resident accounts funded by the transaction, and/or taking any other actions allowed by law and/or School or Community policy. We also reserve the right to not accept payment for Authorized User in the future and to notify the School or Community of the disputed credit/debit card transaction.
  <br /><br />
  <div class="mat-title">10. Refunds</div>
  <br />If you are not satisfied with any goods or service purchased with a payment made through the Service, you agree to resolve the issue with the associated School or Community. The methods for refunds are determined solely by the School or Community, and you agree to not seek refunds from the Service Provider or Horizon after Service Provider has deposited the payment amount into the School's or Community's designated account. If you would like a refund of any payment amount that has not been used to purchase goods or services, you must contact the participating School or Community directly.
